# 24

This is a time-old classic where players attempt to make the number 24 by manipulating four numbers using standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

### Creating a Room -

Make a room by clicking the create room button on the `/room` page. (Note: creating a private room doesn't work yet). Then, wait for another user to join your room.

### Gameplay -

Place an expression that uses the four numbers displayed that evaluates to 24 in the input bar. Standard order of operations apply. Only other character allowed besides numbers and operations are parantheses.

Once game is completed, it will be a race to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Currently, players are just finding 3 expressions to win and are not synced with opponent.

### Known bugs -

Rooms sometimes continue to be displayed even when no one is in them.
